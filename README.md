Lessons Learned - 
Negotiate Hard , Have multiple offers , Don't get lowballed (Very Important as many companies are trying to leverage market situation) . So the CTC you accept will most likely will remain the same for atleast a year, so negotiate accordingly. 

Instead of getting overwhelmed , focus on One step , One interview , One Company at a time .Learn from each interview and Grind for the next one.  
Your 2-3 months of efforts would make a huge difference .
Frankly a very few careers in the world offer such ROI on your efforts So be grateful for that and GRIND.
